            <p>Here at Quinton's Burger & Fries, we understand the costs of food these days. That's why we jack up our prices 
                ten times more than our competitors' prices. Not only that, but we have a personal guarantee that we'll always 
                mess up your order, every single time. You'll never know what you'll end up eating when ordering at Quinton's;
                it's a rage inducing experience that you'll never get used to!</p>

            <h1 class="large-heading">How We Operate</h1>
            <p>We treat operations here at Quinton's like a total joke (just like our company). Not only are we always understaffed
                and undersupplied, we also operate in a timely manner (and not the fast type). We're proud to say that we are the
                slowest operating resturant in the entire country! If you enjoy waiting around for hours just for a simple hamburger,
                then Quinton's is the resturant for you! Come visit us at our only location in Turnaround, CA for a totally 
                regrettable experience!</p>
